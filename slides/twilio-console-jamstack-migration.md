# What is the .twilio[Twilio] Console?

---

class: inverse, middle

# A SPA that enables customers to build, configure and monitor applications on the .twilio[Twilio] platform.

???

- Everything from SMS to Video to a full on contact center.

- each product is its own app, most of which are maintained by 1 or more teams

# Essentially, legacy Console was a microfrontend architecture stitched together on the backend.

???

- This in of itself is not a bad thing, however the trade offs playing out over time were not ideal for our situation

TODO: would it make sense to put a diagram here instead?

# Legacy Console: Issues
]

.right-panel[
- First render always goes through US
- Crossing products ALWAYS needs full page refresh
- Share development environments `dev` -> `stage` -> `prod`
- Teams have complete autonomy (almost)
]

???

- Always having to go to a US region is slow, especially outside the us
- It's a pretty common flow to buy a number and then use another product like messaging, our customers quite often would have multiple tabs open to mitigate this
- Some applications have errors that are spread out in multiple projects, while others are handled by catch all logic
- 30+ teams means 30+ different ways of doing things
- Org structure did not encourage sharing methods and practices accross teams
- Less time to focus on solving problems for the customer

# New Console

???

- Improve the customer experiences of the console, globally
- Enable teams to focus on what matters most, solving problems for their customers

# Architecture
]

.right-panel[
- Jamstack hosted on Netlify
- Shared CI/CD pipeline
- Legacy code is iframed into new Console
- Everything is an "Application Package"
]

???

- Initial request and all static assets come from the nearest CDN node
- One CI/CD means that you don't need to roll your own or maintain your own system
- The iframe approach allows for incremental migration at the page level
- Code splitting applications keeps the intial payload small
- Application package = code split bundles wrapped in Error Boundaries
- Error boundaries on the application allows error routing to go to the correct team

???

- To get a review from a teammate you used to have to check out the PR branch and spin up the stack locally
- Teams were either not getting feedback from product and design or would batch it up and do all the reviews right before launch

# Closing

class: middle, inverse

# The Jamstack architecture has caused a shift in how .twilio[Twilio] thinks about frontend applications.

???

- Other teams working outside the Console are starting to plan their migration to a Jamstack architecture
- The Console is moving towards a truely global presence to meet our customers where they are
- It a deeper focus on solving problems for our customers
