title: Effective Syncs With Distributed Teams

Over the past few years I've participated or lead syncs in both fully distributed, partially distributed and centrally located teams. I've learned that doing effective syncs in a distributed team is similar to doing them in a centrally located team. However, there are a few differences that make distributed team syncs a little more difficult than centrally located team syncs. I'll share a process that has been borrowed from many different sources and tweaked over time with new teammates and companies.

## Why Do This?

## Define A Process

The driver for the meeting should be a real time collaborative document like [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), [Notion](http://notion.so) or [Dropbox Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper). This is important because it allows the entire team to follow along and participate before, during and after the meeting. Everyone should join the call individually and preferably on a headset to keep the noise down.

## Gotchas

- Timezones
- One person overpowering the meeting
- Partially distributed teams

## Teach Others and Practice

TODO: close, make it clear this can and should be tweaked for the team
