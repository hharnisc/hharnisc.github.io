title: Effective Syncs With Distributed Teams

Over the past few years I've participated or lead syncs in both fully distributed, partially distributed and centrally located teams. I've learned that doing effective syncs in a distributed team is similar to doing them in a centrally located team. However, there are a few differences that make distributed team syncs a little more difficult than centrally located team syncs. I'll share a process that has been borrowed from many different sources and tweaked over time with new teammates and companies.

## Why Do This?


## Define The Process

The driver for the meeting should be a real time collaborative document like [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), [Notion](http://notion.so) or [Dropbox Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper). This is important because it allows the entire team to follow along and participate before, during and after the meeting. Participants should join the call individually and preferably on a headset to keep the noise down.

### Before

If you don't already have a shared document, create one with the template below. If you do have a shared document create a new entry at the top of the document with the same template. Update the `YYYY-MM-DD` with the date the sync will take place. Share this with all the participants of the meeting as early as possible and ask team members to add agenda items. The longer agenda items are on the list will mean that agenda items get more exposure. Participants will have time to think about each item. About an hour before the meeting prompt participants (a calendar or slack reminder is great for this) to add missing agenda items to the list.

### During



### After

## Template

Here's a template written in Markdown that can be used to drive distributed team syncs:

```md
# YYYY-MM-DD

## Agenda

- [ ] go over last weeks action items
- [ ] **add action items here**
- [ ] make sure this weeks action items have an assignee and are prioritized

## Notes

- What did the team talk about?
  - some more context

## Action Items

- [ ] Action items from the meeting @harrison

```


## Meeting Roles

Shoutout to [@vaurorapub](https://twitter.com/vaurorapub) for teaching us about meeting roles when I was at Buffer.

There are a few variations of this but there are essentially four roles:

### The Leader

Develops the agenda, guides the group through the meeting and ensures that the team has equal speaking opportunities.

### The Recorder

Ensures everyone has access to the agenda (before, during and after), takes notes during the meeting and records action items during the meeting.

### The Timekeeper

Ensures that the team is spending the appropriate amount of time on each agenda item. When agenda items go long, this person can interject and request an action item for a followup meeting or move on if the conversation is unproductive. The timekeeper can also contribute to the conversation.

### The Participant

Understands the agenda before the meeting and clarifies agenda items that they added during the meeting. Contributes to the conversation around agenda items.

## Gotchas

- Timezones
- One person overpowering the meeting
- Partially distributed teams
- Number of people in a call

## Teach Others and Practice

TODO: close, make it clear this can and should be tweaked for the team
