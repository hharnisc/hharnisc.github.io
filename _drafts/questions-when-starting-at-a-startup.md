title: What To Ask Before Joining A Startup

---

When I first joined a startup in 2012 I did my best to ask the right questions when interviewing. My engineering background prepared me for engineering tasks and helped my write a great resume, but it didn't prepare me well for how to evaluate a startup offer. While this might be obvious to some, this is what I wish I knew when trying to break into the startup scene.

# Foundation

Making sure you've got what you need in your day to day is very important. Unless you are independently wealthy, _don't take a job that can't cover your cost of living or does not provide health insurance_. This means you need to spend some time to understand your monthly budget (good to do this even if you aren't interviewing). A good rule of thumb is 25% of your take home pay should go towards your housing, if you're looking to move the the Bay Area up to 40% can be done but you'll have to minimize eating out or have a second income.

If you need to relocate for the job it is very common for companies to offer relocation packages. I've moved across the country twice and it cost around $3000-$6000 for things like:

- relocation cubes (https://www.upack.com/)
- shipping your car (https://www.uship.com/vehicles/)
- if you don't ship your car, hotel while traveling
- food while traveling
- hotel for a few nights while finding more permanent housing
- registration fees (license plate, sticker, etc.)

Both times we moved we packed ourselves, which we could do because we're both healthy 20 somethings. So adjust if you plan on hiring movers.

1. What is the base salary?
2. Could you send me the health, eye and dental insurance plans?
3. Do you offer relocation (if you need it)

# Equity

So much of how much equity you're offered depends on your experience and the stage of the company. This part of the guide will focus on options, since at the time of writing options are the most common way for startups to offer equity. [Here's an article on how options work](https://a16z.com/2016/08/24/options-ownership/).

The first goal is to understand the percentage of shares the company is offering you. It is pretty common to get a written offer with the raw number of shares. While this is helpful you're only getting part of the equation, since the number of shares doesn't mean much if there are millions of shares already issued.

Here's a nice formula from Buffer that shows one way of determining startup equity amounts: https://open.buffer.com/buffer-open-equity-formula/. This formula is helpful because it takes risk into account by considering the number of people in the company. The smaller the company the larger amount of risk you're taking, thus a greater reward if things work out.

Lets say you're a relatively new engineer (2-3 years experience) and joining a company with 10 employees. A fair amount of equity would be around 0.3% - 0.7%

In the recent years it has become more common for companies offer a 10 year exercise window on stock options. This means that you've 10 years to decide to buy or pass on stock options once they've vested. However it is still pretty standard to have 90 day exercise window. This means that you might have to make a tough choice and pass up on stock options if you don't have the cash on hand within 90 days of leaving. Companies that have shorter exercise windows often end up paying out people who are there during an exit. Here's some more information if you're interesting in learning more: https://blog.colony.io/on-creating-a-better-employee-equity-plan-d89bcab4a4e2/

It is also important to note that the earlier you join the company, the more dilution events you'll experience. An example of a dilution event would be raising another round of funding. This is another reason why joining a company early on should offer more equity. If you joining a company around a Series A raise, you can usually expect to see around 20% - 30% dilution.

Lastly there is the strike price, which is the price that you pay when your options vest. The strike price is often determined by the board, so you might not be able to get this before you join. What's important about the strike price is that it is the starting point, so the company needs to grow for you to make money from selling options. So if you can't get the strike price, make sure it is a company that you believe will grow. This usually means that the earlier you join the lower your strike price will be, to compensate for the risk.

After you've got a better understanding of the percentage of shares the company is offering you and the number of issued shares, you can start to get an idea of the potential value of the options. Here's a helpful startup equity calculator: https://comp.data.frontapp.com/

Most importantly, the majority of startups fail. The equity could be worth nothing, which is why it is so important to have a strong foundation.

4. How many total options are offered?
5. What is the total number of issued shares?
6. What is the vesting schedule?
7. What is the exercise window of vested options?
8. What is the strike price? (You might not get an answer to this one)

# Funding

When it comes to funding it is more than just understanding the burn rate. Getting to know who is investing in the company and some history can be very telling.

Let's start with the basics. You need to know the total amount of funding, how much cash they have on hand (preferably that day) and the burn rate. This gives you an idea of the scale that the company is operating at as well as understanding how quickly they're spending cash.

After learning about operating costs and spending it is important to ask who has invested into the company. The investors can have a profound impact on the company culture and the direction of the company. Tools like [AngelList](https://angel.co/) and [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) can give you information about previous investments and if they're an individual you can usually find them on LinkedIn.

While a bit forward, ask if the company has failed to make payroll in the last year. If they have struggled to make payroll in the past, this makes choosing the startup a riskier venture and might be a signal that the founders are having trouble raising money.

9. What is the total amount of funding raised?
10. How much cash is on hand?
11. What is the [burn rate](https://baremetrics.com/academy/burn-rate)?
12. What round of funding has the company raised?
13. Who has invested in the company?
14. In the last year has the company failed to make payroll?

# Board

Just like the investors, the board can have a huge impact on the direction of the company. Determining if the board is healthy for the company is difficult because it is highly subjective. Basically it comes down the deeply unsatisfying _it depends_.

When looking at the board you're looking for an imbalance in power. If an individual or closely connected group on the board can lock or overturn a decision themselves there is a higher chance that the board is unhealthy. A board with concentrated power is almost the same as an individual making all the decisions. Concentrated power is not objectively bad, especially if you know the people with control well and trust that they will do the right thing.

15. Who is on the board of directors?
16. How many seats do they have?

# Responsibilities

Getting an understanding about what you'll be working and who you'll be working with will help you picture what the job will be like. People often describe working at a startup like packing ten years into a single years worth of learning. Unless you're a deep expert in a field (that the startup needs help with) you're going to be learning on the job to get things done. Make sure the projects you'll be working on are interesting and will move you in the direction you want to take your career. Or if you're not sure what direction you want to go, chose a job that will expose you to lots of different things you _might_ be interested in. It is not uncommon for a coworker to find something they love doing and become the person who _owns a set of problems or services_ related to that thing.

A caveat to startups is that things change at an accelerated pace. It might be the case that you start working on a project that gets cancelled (sometimes before your first day!). You can get a feel for who much things might change by asking questions about [product market fit](https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/). When talking about product market fit it is critical that the company is working with customers to understand they are solving the right problem. Working with the customer can look like doing customer research, support forums (yes engineers do support sometimes at startups) or some other direct line of contact with the customer. If you're satisfied the company has already identified a product that fits the market, the engineering team is going to be solving whatever problems it needs to in order to build the product. If the company has not found a good fit yet, the focus will be on finding the right problem to solve. The process is commonly referred to as a [pivot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#Pivot) and will likely change your focus.

After you've got an idea about the problem space, you'll want to get to know who you'll be working with. Hopefully the company involves potential teammates in the the interview process so you can meet them and ask questions. If it doesn't you can usually ask to meet with them, especially if they extend you an offer. Consider it a red flag if they won't let you speak to someone on the team. Keep in mind that you'll be spending lots of time working with these people, so you'll want to pretty sure that these are people who you can get along with. That's not to say that everyone will be your new best friend, but they should respect others. This is one of those occasions where you get to choose who you surround yourself with, so make sure these are quality people. If you get a bad feeling about someone, trust your gut here, there are lots of other startups!

17. What projects do you picture I'd work on?
18. Has the company found product market fit?
19. How does the company work collect feedback from customers?
20. Who would I be working with to complete the projects?
21. With each team member
  1. What do you work on?
  2. What's is the company doing well?
  3. What could the company improve on?
